# Offside Detection GUI - Partial Field ðŸš€

A football offside detection application built with Python, Tkinter, OpenCV, PyTorch, and Torchvision.  
This tool uses Mask R-CNN to detect players, applies color clustering to classify teams, and visualizes the offside line based on a partial field homography.  
The user interface supports both English and Persian.
